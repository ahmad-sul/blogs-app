It's such a pleasure to have you here! Just to make sure: I am the guy on the right-hand side of the picture 

A couple of words about my professional life: I graduated from DCI (Digital Career Institute). At DCI I discovered how empowering it can be to build applications and thus built several applications in different programming languages, domains and platforms. Straight out of DCI, I learned  on a large scale web application using JavaScript and Java to help thousands of customers to introduce a feedback culture in their companies. This year gave me a lot of practical experiences in the field and I tried to convey a part of the information on my blog.  Fast forward in 2020, I decided to be web dev. I am always keen to learn something new, so I try to push myself every day. I am open for any opportunities in this field or software engineering, so find out how to work with me.</p>
